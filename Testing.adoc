= Testing

== Which Library

pytest vs UnitTest::
    UnitTest was said to have a lot of boilerplate.
    pytest is just get stuff done.

pytest vs nose vs unittest::
    slant.co shows people recommending pytest.


== pytest

With src in dir `beetsplug`
and tests in dir `tests`,
running `pytest` just runs the stuff in `tests`.

No arg means run everything, can run just one file.

[Warning]
Python was not complaining when I had 2 methods in a test file
named the same.

[Note]
--quiet and --verbose seem nearly identical.

== Q and A

Is there some sort of strict mode?:: Does not seem so.
